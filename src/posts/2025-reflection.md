A look back at 2025.

<!-- excerpt -->

This is was a tough year for me. 

After a concussion in Feb, I was suffering (and still am) from post concussive based insomnia. At one point I was averaging 2.5 hours of sleep a night for over a month before I realized just how bad it was.

After a month of that I developed chronic full body muscle switches that persist to today. Where my body, face muscles ect just twitch repeatedly 1000s of times a day. It honestly made me lose my mind.

I didn't get my sleep under control until April. From April -> Now my mentality has been "healing".  Thanks to my incredible wife Courtney, therapy and my Drs, I've been able to keep that mindset.

This is all while releasing 2 podcasts week, countless YT videos and serving as the executive producer on Syntax, MCing major confs, speaking internationally and most importantly being a father. 

Not intended to a bummer here, things have been moving in a positive direction since my accident and every month things get better. I've been back in the gym for the past few months, going to get back to dancing every week and returning my life to normal. 

I really just want to say THANK YOU to everyone who followed my work or @syntaxfm this year. I appreciate you very much and thank you to @Sentry for being an amazing company to work for and the entire @syntaxfm crew for being the very best people.
